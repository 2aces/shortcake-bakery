== Installation ==
It's a plugin! Install it like any other. 

Most of the shortcodes work out of the box, but you'll need to whitelist any domains you want to be eligible for script and iFrame tag use.

```php
	add_filter( 'shortcake_bakery_whitelisted_script_domains', function(){
		return array(
			'ajax.googleapis.com',		
		);
	});
```

```php
	add_filter( 'shortcake_bakery_whitelisted_iframe_domains', function(){
		return array(
			'buzzfeed.com',		
		);
	});
```
